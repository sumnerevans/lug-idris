.. Requirements:
.. - Introduces the programming language, its goals, and its history
.. - Classifies the language, and provides an overview of the languageâ€™s
     features
.. - Evaluates the language using the criteria presented in class (is it more
     writable than readable? Etcetera etcetera etcetera.)
.. - What is interesting and unique about this language?
.. - Describes syntactic details that may make the language more expressive, but
     avoid describing lots of syntactic details (find a select few details that
     are important to the language)
.. - Describes your example code, why you wrote it, what it shows, what it does,
     what problems you encountered, etc.

What is Idris?
==============

    "Idris is a general purpose pure functional programming language with
    dependent types."

    -- The Idris Website

- **Version 0.1.3** of Idris was released in December of 2009.
- **Version 1.2.0** is the latest stable release and was released on January 9,
  2018.
- Idris was named after the singing dragon in the 1970s UK children's television
  program *Ivor the Engine*.
- Idris development is led by Edwin Brady at the University of St. Andrews.

Properties of Idris
===================

- Idris can be **interpreted, transpiled, or compiled**.
- Idris is **statically typed**.
- Idris is **strongly typed**.
- Idris has **first class functions**, much like Haskell.
- Idris has **first class types**. This means that types can be treated as data.
  In fact, types are the *only* type of data.

Idris Features
==============

Idris is a general purpose language, and thus it has a lot of features. We will
focus on the following aspects of the language.

- Haskell-like Syntax
- Dependent Types
- Proof Assistant

.. TODO as we discuss these, talk about the evaluation metrics of Idris
   (readability, writabality, etc.)

Idris Syntax: Function Signatures
=================================

The Idris function signature syntax is *very* similar to the Haskell function
signature syntax. Here are a few examples of Idris function signatures:

.. code:: idris

    even : Nat -> Bool
    add : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    foo : (a:Nat) -> (b:Nat) -> a = b
    bar : (a:Nat) -> (b:Nat) -> LTE a b

If you are familiar with Haskell, you will note the use of ``:`` rather than
``::``. This makes it look a bit more like a mathematical function definition:

.. math:: f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}.

You will also note that instead of the ``(Type x) => x`` syntax, it uses a more
concise ``(x:Type)`` syntax.

Idris Syntax: Currying and Pattern Matching
===========================================

Because of its foundation in Lambda Calculus, all functions only take a single
argument. We can still handle multiple arguments using *currying*. For example,
the ``plus`` operator is defined as follows:

.. code:: idris

    plus : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    plus   Z      y   = y
    plus   (S k)  y   = S (plus k y)

Like Haskell, functions are implemented using *pattern matching*.

Using Idris as a Proof Assistant
================================

.. TODO run away, run away quickly
.. TODO this section is where we will have our code demos

Quotes From Our Exploration
===========================

    "The concept of a programming language in which the possibility of inline
    assembly is an entirely foreign concept hurts my brain."

..

    "Where do I put it? Do I put it in the type?"

..

    "When your Rust program compiles, you know it won't segfault, or give you
    any undefined behavior at runtime. When your Idris program compiles, you
    throw away your executable, and publish your dissertation."
