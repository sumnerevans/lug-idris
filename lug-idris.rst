.. Requirements:
.. - Introduces the programming language, its goals, and its history
.. - Classifies the language, and provides an overview of the languageâ€™s
     features
.. - Evaluates the language using the criteria presented in class (is it more
     writable than readable? Etcetera etcetera etcetera.)
.. - What is interesting and unique about this language?
.. - Describes syntactic details that may make the language more expressive, but
     avoid describing lots of syntactic details (find a select few details that
     are important to the language)
.. - Describes your example code, why you wrote it, what it shows, what it does,
     what problems you encountered, etc.

Introduction
------------

What is Idris?
==============

    "Idris is a general purpose pure functional programming language with
    dependent types."

    -- The Idris Website

- **Version 0.1.3** of Idris was released in December of 2009.
- **Version 1.2.0** is the latest stable release and was released on January 9,
  2018.
- Idris was named after the singing dragon in the 1970s UK children's television
  program *Ivor the Engine*.
- Idris development is led by Edwin Brady at the University of St. Andrews.

Properties of Idris
===================

- Idris can be **interpreted, transpiled, or compiled**
- Idris is **statically typed**
- Idris is **strongly typed**
- Idris is **purely functional** (much like Haskell)
- Idris has **first class types** (types can be treated as data)
- Idris has **dependent types** (the types are all high on something)

Idris Features
==============

Idris is a general purpose language, and thus it has a lot of features. We will
focus on the following aspects of the language.

- Haskell-like Syntax
- Dependent Types
- Proof Assistant

.. TODO as we discuss these, talk about the evaluation metrics of Idris
   (readability, writabality, etc.)

Syntax
------

Function Signatures
===================

The Idris function signature syntax is *very* similar to the Haskell function
signature syntax. Here are a few examples of Idris function signatures:

.. code:: idris

    even : Nat -> Bool
    add : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    foo : (a:Nat) -> (b:Nat) -> a = b
    bar : (a:Nat) -> (b:Nat) -> LTE a b

If you are familiar with Haskell, you will note the use of ``:`` rather than
``::``. This makes it look a bit more like a mathematical function definition:

.. math:: f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}.

You will also note that instead of the ``(Type x) => x`` syntax, it uses a more
concise ``(x:Type)`` syntax.

Currying and Pattern Matching
=============================

Because of its foundation in Lambda Calculus, all functions only take a single
argument. We can still handle multiple arguments using *currying*. For example,
the ``plus`` operator is defined as follows:

.. code:: idris

    plus : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    plus   Z      y   = y
    plus   (S k)  y   = S (plus k y)

Like Haskell, functions are implemented using *pattern matching*.

Type Definition Syntax
======================

Idris defines several primitives including ``Int``, ``Integer``, ``Double``,
``Char``, ``String``, and ``Ptr``.

There are a bunch of other data types defined in the standard library including
``Nat`` and ``Bool``.

Idris allows programmers to define their own data types. Again, the syntax is
similar to Haskell.

.. code:: idris

    data Nat    = Z   | S Nat
    data List a = Nil | (::) a (List a)

Holes
=====

Idris allows you to leave some of your code unfinished. For example, if we write
the following code in a file called ``even.idr``:

.. code:: idris

    even : Nat -> Bool
    even Z = True
    even (S k) = ?even_rhs

And then load it into Idris:

.. code::

    :Idris> :l even
    Holes: even_rhs
    even> :t even_rhs
      k : Nat
    --------------------------------------
    even_rhs : Bool
    Holes: even_rhs

Dependent Types
---------------

Types
=====

Idris has familiar, Haskell-ish types:

- ``Nat`` - A natural number
- ``Bool`` - A boolean
- ``Char`` - A single charecter
- ``List Int`` - A list of integers
- ``Nat -> Bool`` - A function that takes a natural number and produces a boolean
- ``(Nat, Nat)`` - A tuple of two natural numbers
- ``Int -> Int -> Int`` - A function that takes two arguments

Types as Data
=============

Unlike Haskell, data types can be stored, passed, and constructed like data:

.. code:: idris

    an_int : Int
    an_int = 5

    a_type : Type
    a_type = Int

We could write a function to choose between an ``Int`` and a ``Nat``:

.. code:: idris

    PickInt : Bool -> Type
    PickInt True = Int
    PickInt False = Nat

This is called a **type constructor**.

Dependent Types
===============

Any expression that returns ``Type`` can be used as type itself:

.. code:: idris

    foo : PickInt (True && False)
    foo = 5

    bar : case False of
        True => List Char
        False => String
    bar = "Hello, World!"

These are called **dependent types**, since they *depend* on data.

Useful Dependent Types
======================

``List`` and ``Vect`` are examples of type constructors:

- ``List Int`` is a dynamically sized list of integers.
- ``Vect 10 Int`` is a list of exactly 10 integers.

Since type constructors are simply functions, they support things like currying:

.. code:: idris

    TwoOf : Type -> Type
    TwoOf = Vect 2

The Equality Type Constructor
=============================

The basis for proofs in Idris is the ``(=)`` function. It takes two inputs, and
the return type is a proof that the two inputs have the same value.

- Any :idris:`Nat` is a natural number.
- Any :idris:`Vect 2 Nat` is a list of two natural numbers.
- Any :idris:`(=) (2 + 2) 4` is a proof that 2+2 and 4 have the same value.
- Any :idris:`1 = 3` is a proof that 1 and 3 have the same value.
- Any :idris:`even x = True` is a proof that `x` is even

Using Idris as a Proof Assistant
--------------------------------

What is a Proof Assistant?
==========================

A proof assistant is a software tool to assist with the development of formal
proofs by human-machine collaboration.

**The Idris type system is robust enough that it can be used as a proof
assistant.**

How can Idris be a Proof Assistant?
===================================

Recall from above that equality is a type constructor. This means that we can
pass equalities in and out of functions. This is the basis for all proofs in
Idris.

Take this example function declaration:

.. code:: idris

    plusReduces : (n:Nat) -> plus Z n = n

This is a function which takes any :math:`n \in \mathbb{N}`, and returns a proof
that :math:`0 + n = n`. Any successful implementation of this function will
prove that :math:`0 + n = n`.

Quotes From Our Exploration
===========================

    "The concept of a programming language in which the possibility of inline
    assembly is an entirely foreign concept hurts my brain."

..

    "Where do I put it? Do I put it in the type?"

..

    "When your Rust program compiles, you know it won't segfault, or give you
    any undefined behavior at runtime. When your Idris program compiles, you
    throw away your executable, and publish your dissertation."
