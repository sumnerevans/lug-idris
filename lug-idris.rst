.. Requirements:
.. - Introduces the programming language, its goals, and its history
.. - Classifies the language, and provides an overview of the languageâ€™s
     features
.. - Evaluates the language using the criteria presented in class (is it more
     writable than readable? Etcetera etcetera etcetera.)
.. - What is interesting and unique about this language?
.. - Describes syntactic details that may make the language more expressive, but
     avoid describing lots of syntactic details (find a select few details that
     are important to the language)
.. - Describes your example code, why you wrote it, what it shows, what it does,
     what problems you encountered, etc.

What is Idris?
==============

    "Idris is a general purpose pure functional programming language with
    dependent types."

    -- The Idris Website

- **Version 0.1.3** of Idris was released in December of 2009.
- **Version 1.2.0** is the latest stable release and was released on January 9,
  2018.
- Idris was named after the singing dragon in the 1970s UK children's television
  program *Ivor the Engine*.
- Idris development is led by Edwin Brady at the University of St. Andrews.

Properties of Idris
===================

- Idris can be **interpreted, transpiled, or compiled**.
- Idris is **statically typed**.
- Idris is **strongly typed**.
- Idris has **first class functions**, much like Haskell.
- Idris has **first class types**. This means that types can be treated as data.

Idris Features
==============

Idris is a general purpose language, and thus it has a lot of features. We will
focus on the following aspects of the language.

- Dependent Types
- Haskell-like Syntax
- Proof Assistant

.. TODO as we discuss these, talk about the evaluation metrics of Idris
   (readability, writabality, etc.)

Dependent Types
===============

Consider these two arrays:

.. code:: idris

    [1, 2, 3]
    [1, 2, 3, 4]

What are their types? The first is a 3-dimensional array, the second is
4-dimensional.

.. TODO dependent types

The Equality Type
=================

The basis for proofs in Idris is the ``(=)`` type constructor. It constructs a
type that is dependent on two expressions.

- Any :idris:`Nat` is a natural number.
- Any :idris:`Vect 2 Nat` is a list of two natural numbers.
- Any :idris:`(=) (2 + 2) 4` is a proof that 2+2 and 4 have the same value.
- Any :idris:`1 = 3` is a proof that 1 and 3 have the same value.

**It is impossible to create an instance of** :idris:`1 = 3`

Idris Syntax: Function Signatures
=================================

The Idris function signature syntax is *very* similar to the Haskell function
signature syntax. Here are a few examples of Idris function signatures:

.. code:: idris

    even : Nat -> Bool
    add : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    foo : (a:Nat) -> (b:Nat) -> a = b
    bar : (a:Nat) -> (b:Nat) -> LTE a b

If you are familiar with Haskell, you will note the use of ``:`` rather than
``::``. This makes it look a bit more like a mathematical function definition:

.. math:: f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}.

You will also note that instead of the ``(Type x) => x`` syntax, it uses a more
concise ``(x:Type)`` syntax.

Idris Syntax: Currying and Pattern Matching
===========================================

Because of its foundation in Lambda Calculus, all functions only take a single
argument. We can still handle multiple arguments using *currying*. For example,
the ``plus`` operator is defined as follows:

.. code:: idris

    plus : Nat -> Nat -> Nat
    plus   Z      y   = y
    plus   (S k)  y   = S (plus k y)

Like Haskell, functions are implemented using *pattern matching*.

Idris Syntax: Type Definition Syntax
====================================

Idris defines several primitives including ``Int``, ``Integer``, ``Double``,
``Char``, ``String``, and ``Ptr``.

There are a bunch of other data types defined in the standard library including
``Nat`` and ``Bool``.

Idris allows programmers to define their own data types. Again, the syntax is
similar to Haskell.

.. code:: idris

    data Nat    = Z   | S Nat
    data List a = Nil | (::) a (List a)

Idris Syntax: Holes
===================

Idris allows you to leave some of your code unfinished. For example, if we write
the following code in a file called ``even.idr``:

.. code:: idris

    even : Nat -> Bool
    even Z = True
    even (S k) = ?even_rhs

And then load it into Idris:

.. code::

    :Idris> :l even
    Holes: even_rhs
    even> :t even_rhs
      k : Nat
    --------------------------------------
    even_rhs : Bool
    Holes: even_rhs

Using Idris as a Proof Assistant
================================

A proof assistant is a software tool to assist with the development of formal
proofs by human-machine collaboration.

**The Idris type system is robust enough that it can be used as a proof
assistant.**

Recall from above that equality is a type constructor. This means that we can
pass equalities in and out of functions. This is the basis for all proofs in
Idris.

Take this example function declaration:

.. code:: idris

    plusReduces : (n:Nat) -> plus Z n = n

This is a function which takes any :math:`n \in \mathbb{N}`, and returns a proof
that :math:`0 + n = n`. Any successful implementation of this function will
prove that :math:`0 + n = n`.

Quotes From Our Exploration
===========================

    "The concept of a programming language in which the possibility of inline
    assembly is an entirely foreign concept hurts my brain."

..

    "Where do I put it? Do I put it in the type?"

..

    "When your Rust program compiles, you know it won't segfault, or give you
    any undefined behavior at runtime. When your Idris program compiles, you
    throw away your executable, and publish your dissertation."
